## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JS

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

Basic knowledges about CSS and Vanilla JS:

- centering elements with the flexbox css module with the justify-content and the align-items properties.
- Using variables in the :root area aplying colors.
- Importing font styles from externals sources.
- Using vh and vw to include all the windows width and height and center de main container.
- Using external script javascript files
- Selecting html elements using the DOM.
- setting elements styles in the js file with javascript sintax.
- Using loops to traverse elements in the NodeList array-like object.
- Implement mousemove event for mantain the hover effect after click in one button.


### Continued development

for a begineer, it's important practice and learn every day. The next step after take another challenge with a higher complexity level if keep practice frontend development and focus in other challenges with same level but with another knowledge area. The main goal is learn how to optimize and mantain your code every day you spend and be a good programmer.
